# HR Data Analytics Case Scenarios

This repository contains applied HR Data Analytics scenarios focused on workforce recruitment,  
performance, and employee well-being. The analyses demonstrate how HR data can be used to  
optimize recruitment, improve staff performance, and understand work-life balance patterns.   
The datasets were originally retrieved from **Kaggle** and further modified for analysis.
